I'm very happy to announce a new web application I've been working on in my free time: [RC Marketplace](https://rcmarket.place).

RC Marketplace is an online platform that connects buyers and sellers of remote control products. Whether you're looking to sell a drone, airplane, car, batteries, servos or other RC items, you can list it here.

# How is it different from eBay, Facebook groups or specialized forums?

As you may know, one of my hobbies is to build and fly RC airplanes. I participate in a few big well known RC forums and I'm part of a few other Facebook groups. People publish their items to sell there, but as a buyer looking to find some good deals, these platforms are not ideal. 

I've wasted so much time scrolling through the several often uncategorized listings trying to find something good, that I thought "there's must be a better way". So that's why I decided to build RC Marketplace with one of its main features being its filters that allow the user to find specific products, in their relevant location, quickly. And this is just the beginning. The plan is to enhance filters to make them even more useful and precise for users to find the exact thing they're searching for.

# Is it free?

Yes, RC Marketplace is free to use. For now, sellers can have up to 10 active listings at any given time. Sellers have the option to pay for increasing the visibility of their listings, by adding points to their listings and this way making them appear higher than listings with lower number of points.

# Global reach, local relevance

RC Marketplace is designed to be used anywhere in the world. Since the buying and selling of products is intrinsically local, sellers are required to indicate the country of the product they are listing. They can also optionally indicate the city and zip code.
RC Marketplace recognizes the countries that have been added to the listings and displays them as a filter, so that buyers can find what they are looking for in the region relevant to them.

# What's next?

There are many new features in the pipeline that I'll be writing about when they are released. The next one coming is the localization of the app to languages other than english.
